                <p>Hello, and Happy New Years to everybody who's reading this. Well I've gone out of my way on not updating the blog for almost 8 months atp, i've been REALLY busy with personal stuff and other projects. First of all, it's been a year since I first made this website, I wanted to keep it as a portfolio of all of the stuff I've been doing publicly and to keep updates on myself (which you can tell im not really consistent with), so Happy birthday <a>https://flowcheer.github.io/</a> ig? The last months of 2024 were my Winter Break and I had a lot of enjoyable moments and some other situations I've moved on from, specifically friends because I just didn't like being around that circle anymore, and to focus more on myself and my studies. Talking about stuff like these, you might also have noticed that I havent updated the pizzaface maze in a year, and I doubt I will since I've lost motivation and I just don't have the time to keep working on it and now I'm focusing on The Ohio Mix, a project me and the same people that are making NNB have been working on since June of last year to gain some experience on making games before continuing with the development of NNB, you might be able to play it on the first 2 weeks of this February so stay tuned! If you were close to me you might also have heard about the Ohio Team channel, where we upload edits of Kanye West songs, if you want go give it a go! And that's all I wanted to address about myself, see y'all on the next post.</p>
